        "Q18- What is Cardano? This is similar to step 4, with much more detail on the backgroound of the cardano.\n",
        "\n",
        "A- Cardano (or Cardano Settlement Layer) is a fully open source decentralized public blockchain and cryptographic currency designed and developed by IOHK in 2015. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which aims to provide more cutting edge features than any other protocol created. It is the first blockchain platform to form out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first approach. The team creating Cardano consists of global expert engineers and researchers from the university of edinburgh, the University of Athens and the university of Connecticut.\n",
        " \n",
        "Q19- Why does cardano exist?\n",
        "\n",
        "A- Cardano began as an effort to shift the method in which cryptocurrency are designed and developed. There are three main reasons Cardano was created as follows. 1. TO develop a more successful protocol to improve the layering i nthe design of cryptocurrencies. 2. The team wants to increase the appreciation for cryptographic research since that is their main approach to building cardano. 3. Cardano wants to make accommodation for future updates like soft and hard folks more commomplace since most altcoins fail to do so. Overall, the focus of Cardano is to develop a more equal and sustainable ecosystem that better tends to the needs of it's users and other systems desiring integration. You can think of Cardano as Bitcoin reimagined with the freedom to mend the design flaws of bitcoin.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20- What are the pros?\n",
        "\n",
        "A- Cardano is completely open-source and is in the business of solving cryptocurrency industry's scalability and democratized voting issues through a smart contract platform that is programmed to be inter-operable with other cryptocurrencies. Adding to the benefits, Cardano is aiming to simplify atomix swaps and remove the neceessity of exchanges. With a world class team including one of the co-founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano has a lot of smart academicians, technicians and scholars working on Cardano's technical solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21- What are the cons?\n",
        "\n",
        "A- The market capitilization of Cardano remains in the top 10 with a circulating supply of around 25 billion coins out of the maximum supply of 45 billion in total, For cardano the biggest disadvantage is the technical hinderance of it's circulating supply. It is likely that there there will be continuous supply at higher leverls. While the benefits and applications of Cardano's technology will be substantial, the large supply of coins pose a considerable constraint on the cryptocurrency."
